# Algobed

The project was made to replicate a self-driving car. We used an overhead camera which took the image of the map and we found the obstacles in the map as we applied image processing on it. 

We got the location of all the obstacles in the map. The location of the obstacles was then fed to the A* algorithm so that it could find the shortest path from point A to point B. The bot then moved from A to B. This project also made use of pyserial and Arduino. 

The applications of this can be in the military or it can be used as self-driving cars for other people.
